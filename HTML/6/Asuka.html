    <p><b>Asuka Langley Souryuu (惣流・アスカ・ラングレー)</b></p>
    <p>Age: 14 (28 mentally in Evangelion: 3.0)</p>
    <p>Height: 5'1" / 155 cm</p>
    <p>Birthdate: December 4, 2001</p>
    <p>Zodiac sign: Sagittarius</p>
    <p>Blood type: A</p>
    <p>Origin: Wilhelmshaven, Lower Saxony, Germany</p>
    <p>Asuka is the Second Child ('Second Children' in the
         Japanese versions of NGE), who pilots Evangelion 
         Unit 02. She is from Germany, but with an American 
         father and a half-German, half-Japanese mother. In 
         the Rebuild of Evangelion series of movies, her name 
         is changed to Asuka Langley Shikinami.</p>
    <p>Her mother, Kyoko Zeppelin Souryuu, went insane after 
        an Eva-related experiment and began to believe that a
         doll that resembled Asuka was, in fact, her daughter, 
         to the point that she refused to acknowledge the real 
         Asuka. Kyoko Zeppelin Souryuu committed suicide on the 
         very day that Asuka was chosen to become an Eva pilot. 
         On that day, Asuka promised herself that she would never 
         cry again. This event gives her an innate hatred of dolls 
         and all things that she perceives to be doll-like, 
         especially Rei. Despite those feelings Asuka shows no 
         hesitation when required to cooperate with Rei when 
         necessary, proving her to be committed and professional
          regarding her duties as an Eva pilot.</p>
