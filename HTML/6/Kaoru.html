    <p><b>Kaworu Nagisa (渚 カヲル)</b></p>
    <p>Age: 15</p>
    <p>Sex: Male</p>
    <p>Birthday: September 13, 2000</p>
    <p>Relations: Shinji Ikari (Ally)</p>
    <p>Kaworu Nagisa is both the 17th Angel and the Fifth Child. 
        Although classified as an Angel, Kaworu is similar to Rei Ayanami 
        in being a Seed of Life that inhabits a human body. 
        Despite his human form, Kaworu does not consider himself
         to be human, since he refers to humans as "the Lilin".</p>
    <p>Kaworu appears humming the fourth movement of Beethoven's 
        Ninth Symphony, the same music that plays during his descent 
        into Terminal Dogma and so serves as a leitmotif for his character.
         The Ninth Symphony itself incorporates an adaptation Friedrich 
         Schiller's Ode to Joy (Ode an die Freude), a poem dedicated to the 
         unity of all men under God. The moment Kaworu opens the doors 
         to Terminal Dogma is in synch with the line "Und der Cherub 
         steht vor Gott"- "And the Cherub (Angel) stands before God".</p>
    <p>Kaworu's body appears to have been created as a result of the 
        Contact Experiment with Adam, wherein DNA from an unknown human 
        donor dove into and fused with Adam's flesh, explaining Hyuga's 
        discovery that Kaworu was "born" on the day of Second Impact. 
        SEELE salvaged Adam's disembodied soul into Kaworu, whom they 
        may have recovered in embryonic form in Antarctica.
        Kaworu's origin from Adam, only intimated in the anime, is flatly 
        stated in Sadamoto's manga.</p>
