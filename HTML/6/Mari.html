    <p><b>Mari Illustrious Makinami (真希波・マリ・イラストリアス)</b></p>
    <p>Mari Illustrious Makinami is an Evangelion pilot introduced 
        into the franchise during the second installment of the 
        four part theatrical remake series, Rebuild of Evangelion. 
        Little is known about her as of yet except that she is the 
        pilot of the Provisional Evangelion Unit-05 which differs 
        from previous incarnations drastically featuring four mechanical 
        "legs" that end in wheels and a lack of hands which have been 
        replaced with a jousting lance and "claw." Because of its unique 
        design, Mari pilots her Eva wearing a helmet-like contraption 
        and her plugsuit is equipped with several attachments that connect 
        to tubing that apparently help her in moving the Evangelion</p>
    <p>Mari is probably the most content with being an Eva pilot. 
        She is also shown to be more informed than the other pilots, 
        knowing various backdoors into both Nerv and the Eva 
        operational programs and access Eva abilities known to only 
        the higher-up staff of Nerv. Mari also revels in piloting Eva, 
        usually singing over the comm-radio before excitedly engaging 
        an Angel in combat.</p>
