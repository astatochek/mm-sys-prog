    <p><b>Rei Ayanami (綾波 レイ)</b></p>
    <p>Age: Unknown</p>
    <p>Birthday: Unknown</p>
    <p>Height: 4' 11" / 149 cm</p>
    <p>Sex: Female</p>
    <p>Guardian: Gendo Ikari</p>
    <p>Ayanami Rei is the "First Children" of the 
        Marduk Report and the pilot of EVA-00. 
        Shrouded in mystery, she is socially withdrawn 
        and rarely shows emotion. Seemingly completely 
        devoted to her duty as an EVA pilot, her only 
        apparent human relationship being with Nerv 
        commander Ikari Gendou.</p>
    <p>However, Rei comes to know Ikari Shinji and 
        after some initial mistrust they come to 
        better understand each other, revealing more 
        of Rei`s emotional side and helping Shinji 
        trust others again.</p>
    <p>It is eventually revealed that Rei is not a 
        normal human, but an Angel - Lilith. Soulless 
        clones of her are kept hidden in the deepest 
        levels of NERV, to be used both as replacement 
        bodies for Rei should she die and as "cores" 
        of the Dummy Plugs. Gendou, knowing of Rei's 
        true identity, plans to make Rei help him control 
        Instrumentality to reunite him with his wife.</p>
