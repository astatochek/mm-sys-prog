    <p><b>Shinji Ikari (碇 シンジ)</b></p>
    <p>Age: 14</p>
    <p>Birthday: June 6, 2001</p>
    <p>Height: 155 cm (5'1")</p>
    <p>Blood type: A</p>
    <p>Father: Gendo Ikari</p>
    <p>Mother: Yui Ikari</p>
    <p>Guardian: Misato Katsuragi</p>
    <p>Shinji Ikari is the Third Child ("Third Children" 
        in Japanese), who pilots Unit 01. He is the son 
        of Gendo and the late Yui Ikari. Abandoned by 
        his father, Gendo, when he was a toddler, Shinji 
        often ran away from difficult situations. As a 
        pilot, he panics easily and reacts very poorly 
        to unexpected events. Over time and with encouragement 
        from Misato, he learns to be less cowardly, more outspoken, 
        and more confident.</p>
    <p>His progress is all undone when he is forced to 
        kill the only person who ever openly expressed 
        love toward him. His only friends are Toji and 
        Kensuke, but he apparently cares about Rei more 
        than even he realizes, although everyone around 
        him seems to think that his feelings are obvious. 
        Despite his rapport with Rei, Asuka is a sexual 
        presence in his life, and is ultimately shown to 
        be a figure of great emotional importance to him 
        as well. Though not immediately apparent, their 
        relationship is a powerful driving force for both 
        characters throughout the series. Their confused, 
        back-and-forth emotional interchanges are a source 
        of considerable guilt and tension for both parties. 
        While Asuka is attracted to Shinji, she is afraid to 
        admit to being dependent on anyone; so instead of 
        expressing affection, she teases Shinji (often with 
        sexual overtones), hoping to "provoke" him into 
        initiating a closer relationship. Significantly, 
        she gives him his first kiss (supposedly out of boredom, 
        though the Director's Cut makes clear that the kiss 
        meant a lot more to her than she lets on). However, 
        due to his own emotional issues, Shinji is unable to 
        recognize Asuka's actions for their true intent, and 
        is only confused and hurt by her flirting mixed with abuse.</p>
    <p>Since Asuka is constantly heaping him with accusations 
        and blame, his most natural response is to withdraw and 
        hide himself, both emotionally and literally. To make 
        matters worse, Asuka only finds herself more and more 
        frustrated by Shinji's failure to respond to her advances, 
        and in turn only abuses him more and more harshly, which 
        only makes him withdraw further, thus continuing the vicious 
        cycle. Their tense relationship reaches a breaking point 
        toward the end of the story; when Asuka's stress finally 
        causes her to degrade into a completely withdrawn state, 
        Shinji tries to comfort her, only to be coldly rejected.</p>
